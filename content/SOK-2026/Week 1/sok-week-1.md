# Week 1: Getting Started

This first week of **Season of KDE** was mostly about learning and testing things out before I start writing the real code.

## 🌐 Falkon & XMPP
I want to use XMPP to sync bookmarks, so I spent this week figuring out how it actually works.

* **Libervia:** I messed around with Libervia just to see how "PubSub" (the tech I'm using) handles data. It was good to see it working for real instead of just reading about it.
* **QXmpp:** I wrote a small script to post a blog post to my XMPP account. It worked! This proves I can send data back and forth using the library.
* **Falkon Extension:** I also made a super simple "Hello World" extension for Falkon, just to understand how to load a plugin into the browser.

## 🎲 The Mancala Game
For the game project, I need to build a version called **Vamana Guntalu**.

* I spent some time actually playing the game to make sure I understand the rules perfectly (how capturing works, scoring, etc).
* I wrote down all the rules so I can code them into the engine later.

I also had a good chat with my mentors to make sure I'm on the right track. Now that I know how the tools work, I'm ready to start building next week.
