## Announcing My Season of KDE 2026 Projects

Jan 25, 2026

I am excited to announce that I am officially participating in **Season of KDE (SoK) 2026**! I’ll be working on two distinct but equally exciting projects that touch on game development and decentralized web technologies.

### Project 1: Expanding the MankalaEngine

The first part of my project involves the **MankalaEngine**. I will be implementing **Vamana Guntalu**, a traditional Indian variant of the Mancala game. This involves deep-diving into the C++ engine logic to ensure the specific rules and board layouts of this variant are perfectly captured.

### Project 2: Falkon Bookmark Sync via XMPP

My second project is a technical challenge involving the **Falkon browser**. I am creating a Falkon extension that allows users to synchronize their website bookmarks across different devices.

What makes this unique is the stack:

- **XMPP Protocol:** Used as the communication backbone for real-time data transfer.
- **WebXDC:** Enabling the application to run as a cross-platform, decentralized web app within the browser.

### Mentorship and Community

I am honored to be working under the guidance of my project advisors: **Schimon Jehudah**, **Juraj Oravec**, and **Benson Muite**. Their expertise has already been invaluable in helping me navigate the KDE ecosystem.

I’ll be posting regular updates here as I hit my milestones. Stay tuned!
