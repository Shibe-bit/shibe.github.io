# Beyond the Code: What I Learned from My First KDE Junior Job

Today, I learned something crucial in my **Season of KDE** journey by submitting a “Junior Job” for **Lokalize**. While the code change was small, the lesson I learned about professional maintenance was huge.

## The Mistake: “Just Merge It”

My task was to remove an obsolete reference to ‘Techbase’ in the source code. In my rush to finish, I made a classic beginner mistake: I pushed multiple commits to fix a small syntax error (a messed-up bracket!) without cleaning them up.

## The Feedback

One of the maintainers, **Johnny**, gave me feedback that I’ll carry with me throughout my career. He explained that while the code might work, the **Git history** needs to be clean for the developers who come after us.

## Final Thoughts

This experience taught me that in a massive project like KDE, communication is key. It’s better to ask “why” first than to guess and leave a messy trail in the history.
